Sharing an old aha moment. A very old video from good old G.Strang  here https://youtu.be/osh80YCg_GM.
By far the most elegant way to remember the best solution to Ax=b where it is not possible (b is not part of the column space of A) … is simply to solve Ax=p where p is the projection of b on the column space of A… No need to remember the solution (AtAx=At.b so x = (AtA)-1.Atb)

a straight line Linear fit to the log odds…   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfKanl1aSG0

The SGD version includes "learning_rate", which relates to the kind of schedule to use for the learning rate. "eta0" is the parameter that we will use to set the initial learning rate.
